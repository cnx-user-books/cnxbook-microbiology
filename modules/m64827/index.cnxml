<para id="fs-id1167662603827">Fungal infections of the nervous system, called <term>neuromycoses</term>, are rare in healthy individuals. However, neuromycoses can be devastating in immunocompromised or elderly patients. Several eukaryotic parasites are also capable of infecting the nervous system of human hosts. Although relatively uncommon, these infections can also be life-threatening in immunocompromised individuals. In this section, we will first discuss neuromycoses.</para><section id="fs-id1167662491571">
<title>Cryptococcocal Meningitis</title>
<para id="fs-id1167658029780"><term class="no-emphasis"><emphasis effect="italics">Cryptococcus neoformans</emphasis></term> is a fungal pathogen that can cause meningitis. This yeast is commonly found in soils and is particularly associated with pigeon droppings. It has a thick capsule that serves as an important <term class="no-emphasis">virulence factor</term>, inhibiting clearance by phagocytosis. Most <emphasis effect="italics">C. neoformans</emphasis> cases result in subclinical respiratory infections that, in healthy individuals, generally resolve spontaneously with no long-term consequences (see <link class="target-chapter" document="m58915">Respiratory Mycoses</link>). In immunocompromised patients or those with other underlying illnesses, the infection can progress to cause <term class="no-emphasis">meningitis</term> and granuloma formation in brain tissues. <emphasis effect="italics">Cryptococcus</emphasis> antigens can also serve to inhibit cell-mediated immunity and delayed-type hypersensitivity.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167658342454"><emphasis effect="italics">Cryptococcus</emphasis> can be easily cultured in the laboratory and identified based on its extensive capsule (<link target-id="OSC_Microbio_26_04_Cryptococc"/>). <emphasis effect="italics">C. neoformans</emphasis> is frequently cultured from urine samples of patients with disseminated infections.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167660443263">Prolonged treatment with antifungal drugs is required to treat cryptococcal infections. Combined therapy is required with <term class="no-emphasis">amphotericin B</term> plus <term class="no-emphasis">flucytosine</term> for at least 10 weeks. Many antifungal drugs have difficulty crossing the <term class="no-emphasis">blood-brain barrier</term> and have strong side effects that necessitate low doses; these factors contribute to the lengthy time of treatment. Patients with AIDS are particularly susceptible to <emphasis effect="italics">Cryptococcus</emphasis> infections because of their compromised immune state. <term class="no-emphasis">AIDS</term> patients with cryptococcosis can also be treated with antifungal drugs, but they often have relapses; lifelong doses of fluconazole may be necessary to prevent reinfection.</para>

<title>Neuromycoses</title>
<para id="fs-id1167662559120">Neuromycoses typically occur only in immunocompromised individuals and usually only invade the nervous system after first infecting a different body system. As such, many diseases that sometimes affect the nervous system have already been discussed in previous chapters. <link target-id="OSC_Microbio_26_04_neuromycos"/> presents some of the most common fungal infections associated with neurological disease. This table includes only the neurological aspects associated with these diseases; it does not include characteristics associated with other body systems.</para>
